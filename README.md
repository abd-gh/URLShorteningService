# Url Shortening Service

---

## Description
This project provides an URL shortening service, in addition to entering an expiration date for the shorten URL, you can use the shortened URL many times within the validity date. The project was built by sending the URL and the expiration date by POST JSON, Before sending JSON, it will be checked if the URL and expiration date are valid by JavaScript, when this information is received a shortened URL will be generated by Hashing and storing originalURL, shortenedURL, creationDate and expirationDate, and here the first phase of the project is over.

The second phase of the project is by sending the shortened URL by GET JSON, here the request is processed by searching in the database for this shortened URL, we have three cases: the sent shortened URL is wrong, The sent shortened URL is in the database but has expired, or the sent shortened URL is in the database and has not expired, in this case, will be redirected to the original URL that returned from the database. In each wrong case, there will be a message to explain the error.
